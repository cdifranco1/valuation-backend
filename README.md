# Valuation Backend

The backend for this business valuation application is a RESTful API service, built with Node, Express, and MongoDB. The logic for processing discounted cash flows was implemented using a mostly functional approach. Amazon Cognito was used for authentication services, and the API implemented uses a cognito-express library to verify user tokens.
